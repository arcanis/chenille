# Contributing

Thanks for looking at this file! Here are some basic instructions to get started with ease:

## Run your changes

Chenille is currently a bit difficult to test with live data. The best way you can do that is to fork Chenille, create an empty repository, and configure this new repository to use your Chenille fork.

## Test your changes

- `yarn eslint` to make sure that they follow our rules.

- `yarn tsc` to make sure that types are respected.

- `yarn jest` to make sure that all tests pass.

Running a single test:

- `yarn jest -t <name of the test>`
